    <!--
        This file is only necessary because we are running the web
        server and the application (ejb) server in the same JVM.
        A stand alone client, like a POJO, or a configuration in clusters
        or with tomcat runing in an independer process wouldn't need it.
        Beacuse running both servers in the same JVM is the logical thing
        to do when using just one phisical machine, this file is 
        necessary
